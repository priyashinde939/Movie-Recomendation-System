In this project I have built a content based movie recommender system
using streamlit 

Content Based Filtering - They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it. 

Cosine similarity metric used to measure similarity among the movies

I have used the TMDB 5000 movies dataset to build the model
